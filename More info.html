            <h1>More Information about uses of  Number System:</h1>

                <h2>Binary:</h2>
            <p>Binary number system or Base 2 number system has <b>only</b> two numbers 0 and 1. At first glance it seems quite useless as not a lot can be done with these do digits. This system is actually would be insufficient in day-to-day usage but it has application in computer science. If we look at the core of a computer, in its foundation it is an appliance that runs in electricity. Electricity only has two states one and off which makes binary system very suitable for representing electrical states or bits. <i>A bit by itself isn’t that useful</i>, but combining multiple can solve the issue. A combination of 4-bits is a nibble and a combination of two nibbles is a byte and you can represent 255 numbers with 8 bits. To increase the range you could add more bytes, a 1024 of these bytes make a kilo-byte, 1024 of these kilo-bytes make a mega-bytes and after that there is Gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte and so <br>
            This might seem redundant to us but for a machine having two states it’s just electrical signals. So, we can represent decimal numbers in machine language easily but looking at our daily computer we just don’t use numbers as input in our computers, we use alphanumeric data, or a software might use different colors or shapes or different set of alphabets and numbers. How can we represent them? Easy just set the value of each alphabet to a decimal numbers, hence came the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Every single data that you can think of has an equivalent binary value to represent it, these values may overlap but depending upon the context i.e. if you are using Photoshop or any other photo manipulation software a certain binary number could mean a color and using another application it could be different type of data.

            <h2>Octal</h2>
                <p>The word octal is Latin in origin meaning eight indicating that octal is a base 8 system i.e. having eight numbers from 0 to 7. The octal numbers have many applications and importance such as it is used in computers and digital numbering systems. In the number system, octal numbers can be converted to binary numbers, binary numbers to octal numbers by first converting a binary number to decimal number then decimal number to octal number. <br>
                    The octal Number system is widely used in the world of computer applications and also in the aviation sector to use the number in the form of a code. Based on octal number system applications, several computing systems have been developed. All the modern generation computing systems use 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit words which are further divided into 8-bit words. Similarly, for various programming languages, octal numbers are used for the purpose of coding or to store data in the encrypted language, which can only be understood by the computing machine. <br>
                Octal number system is significant as it uses less bits than the hexa-decimal system, meaning less computation is required. One of the limitations of the octal number system is that computers do not understand the octal numbers in a direct way and hence it has to be converted into binary numbers first.</p>

                <h2>Hexadecimal</h2>
                <p>
                Hexadecimal system has sixteen digits i.e. from 0 to 15. It is very concise and by using a base of 16 means that the number of digits used to signify a given number is usually less than in binary or decimal. It allows you to store more information using less space. It is fast and simple to convert between hexadecimal numbers and binary. Hexadecimal can be used to write large binary numbers in just a few digits. It makes life easier as it allows grouping of binary numbers which makes it easier to read, write and understand. It is more human-friendly, as humans are used to grouping together numbers and things for easier understanding.  Also, writing in less digits lowers the possibility of error occurring.
